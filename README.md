## Project Description
In the following project a game is programmed using python and its respective functions and libraries. In my case, I was inspired by the Risk game, due to its complex algorithms, and created a variant inspired by the history of my country.
## Rules
* The rules are very simple, conquer and expand your empire or lose your territories.
* At the beginning of each round you will roll a dice three times, and depending on the numbers that come out you will be assigned a specific number of soldiers.
* You will place the soldiers in the territory that seems most appropriate
* When the soldiers are assigned to their proper positions the attack will begin

## Workflow
In this project I followed the next steps:
1. Investigated the rules of the game
2. Played the game to understand it better
3. Thought about a variant
4. Writed the pseucode in a sheet
5. Started to programm it
6. Joined all the functions in a class
7. Changed the format to .py
8. Executed it
## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?

I used a trello to organize my work.

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

My repository is very simple.
I have my code in jupyter format and this Readme to explain the project
